# google-homepage
This is one of my first projects using Github, Mac Terminal, and (we'll see what else), as part of The Odin Project's learning modules. 

In this project, I will apparently deconstruct a webpage and rebuild it from scratch - possibly adding a few custon touches here and there.

More to come...
